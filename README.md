  * LeMone and Burke’s Medical-Surgical Nursing: Clinical Reasoning in Patient Care offers the skills and knowledge needed to provide safe, evidence-based care for the diseases and disorders the new nurse will most likely encounter, based on incidence and prevalence data. The theme is that patient care should address the whole person, not just the malfunction of body systems. Rather than memorize medical conditions, readers build the clinical reasoning skills they need to safely perform simple to complex tasks. The 7th edition has a new section on transitions of care and a new chapter linking sleep and health. It is now organized with a more consistent chapter structure for easier navigation.
 
* ### Table of Content:

### 23) A patient care issue has been raised about the actions taken by a nurse who provided care to a patient whose healthcare decisions were considered controversial. What should the nurse manager consult to protect the patient and evaluate the care in question?


1. Nursing Code of Ethics

2. Hospital quality improvement guidelines

3. Nurse Practice Act

4. Critical pathway

Answer: 1

### 29) The director of nursing is reviewing situations that require attention. Which situation is an ethical dilemma that might need to be analyzed by the hospital Ethics Committee?


1. A 20-year-old male patient with an opportunistic disease is HIV positive and does not want to share this information with sexual partners.

2. The nurse-patient ratio is 5:1 on a medical-surgical care area.

3. A nurse inexperienced with electrocardiogram interpretation was assigned to the telemetry unit to provide care.

4. Nursing staff provide medication to patients after doses are dropped on the floor.

Answer: 1


Explanation: 1. A dilemmais a choice between two unpleasant, ethically troubling alternatives. Nurses who provide medical-surgical nursing care face dilemmas almost daily. Many commonly experienced dilemmas involve confidentiality, patient rights, and issues of dying and death. Nurses respect the right to confidentiality of patient information found in the patient's record or secured during interviews. An individual's right to privacy and confidentiality creates a dilemma when it conflicts with the nurse's right to information that may affect personal safety. The law in most states mandates that HIV test results can be given to another person only with the patient's written consent. Many healthcare providers believe that this law violates their own right to personal safety.


2. This situation is not a dilemma but may violate standards of care or standards of practice.

3. This situation is not a dilemma but may violate standards of care or standards of practice.

4. This situation is not a dilemma but may violate standards of care, codes of ethics, or standards of practice.

1. HIPAA

2. ANA standards

3. Professional boundaries

4. State nurse practice acts

5. Standards pertinent to specific hospital protocols

Answer: 3, 4


Explanation: 1. HIPAA involves violations of patient confidentiality.


2. A violation of ethics in the ANA Standards of Care would not apply here.

3. Professional boundaries are the borders between the vulnerability of the patient and the power of the nurse. It is vital that nurses recognize this relationship and establish boundaries to safely and effectively meet the patient's needs. Confusion between the needs of the nurse and those of the patient can result in boundary violations.

4. Professional boundaries are outlined in individual state nurse practice acts.

5. Hospital protocols are not identified in the question; however, the nurse's action violates a professional boundary.

2. Will this promote patient independence?

3. Is this a project that would add value to the hospital experience?

4. Does this research contribute to patient care?

Answer: 4


Explanation: 1. To be relevant, nursing research must have a goal to improve the care that nurses provide patients. This means that all nurses must consider the researcher role to be integral to nursing practice. The research might be valid; however, it does not improve patient care.

2. Identify three to five interventions

3. Ensure the elements of the bundle are independent

4. Ensure the bundle elements are descriptive

5. Mandate that the bundle elements are prescriptive

Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4

2. The bundle has three to five interventions (elements), with strong clinician agreements.

3. Each bundle is relatively independent. The bundle is developed so that if one of the interventions of care is not implemented it will not affect whether other bundle elements are implemented.

4. Bundle elements should be descriptive rather than prescriptive, to allow for local customization and appropriate clinical judgment.

5. Bundle elements should be descriptive rather than prescriptive.
